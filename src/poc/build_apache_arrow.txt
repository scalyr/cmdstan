following instructions on how to build the C++ libraries here:  https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/cpp/building.html#building-arrow-cpp

the minimal release build instructions are:
```
git clone https://github.com/apache/arrow.git
cd arrow/cpp
mkdir release
cd release
cmake ..
make
```

Program "arrow_poc" (arrow proof of concept) reads in a local CSV file
and writes a Parquet file.  This requires using arrow modules:
- COMPUTE (core in memory representation)
- CSV (CSV file format readers/writers)
- FILESYSTEM (local disk files)
- PARQUET (columnar data stuff)

Using CMAKE to create the set of local header and lib.a files needed
to compile and link the programs:

```
cmake ..\
	DARROW_COMPUTE=ON\
	DARROW_CSV=ON\
	DARROW_FILESYSTEM=ON\
	DARROW_PARQUET=ON\
	DARROW_BUILD_STATIC=ON\
	DARROW_BUILD_SHARED=OFF\
	DARROW_DEPENDENCY_SOURCE=BUNDLED\
	DARROW_DEPENDENCY_USE_SHARED=OFF\
	DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\
	DPARQUET_BUILD_TESTS=Off\
	DPARQUET_MINIMAL_DEPENDENCY=OFF\
	DPARQUET_ARROW_LINKAGE=static


make -j4 arrow
make -j4 parquet
make install

```

Once installed, can use GNU make to compile a program - see Makefile in this directory
